# Automatic-Water-System-Using-Aurdino
## Description:
The Automatic Plant watering system I made needed a Soil Moisture Sensor, a Relay Module, an Arduino Uno, a Water Pump. I write code on Arduino IDE, to establish a communication between Soil moisture sensor and relay module using Arduino.  The soil moisture sensor is based on a principle of measuring dielectric permittivity of surrounding medium. In soil, dielectric permittivity is a function of the water content. The sensor creates a voltage proportional to the water content of the soil.
